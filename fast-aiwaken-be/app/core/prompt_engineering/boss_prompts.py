    Focus on these topics: {topics_str}

    Generate a pool of boss fight questions for {username}:
    - 9 Easy questions
    - 10 Medium questions
    - 9 Hard questions

    Each boss fight session uses 10 questions from these pools, scaling difficulty based on {username}â€™s answers (start with medium; go easier if wrong, harder if right).

    For each question:
    - Address {username} directly, e.g., "Now, {username}, what is ...?" and vary the phrasing.
    - Subject: {subject}
    - Each question must have exactly these fields:
    - "id": a unique ID string, e.g., "easy_1", "medium_5"
    - "type": must be **one of** "true_false", "multiple_choice", or "fill_blank"
    - "question_text": the question phrased as the boss speaking to {username}
    - **If type is "multiple_choice": return a list of 4 options labeled "A.", "B.", "C.", and "D."**
    - **If type is not "multiple_choice": omit the "options" field entirely**
    - "correct_answer": the correct answer (must match the option label for multiple choice)
    - "explanation": a clear explanation for the answer
    - "difficulty": "easy", "medium", or "hard"
    - "topic": the relevant topic

    Also include:
    - "boss_intro": a dramatic introduction by the boss
    - "quiz_title": a fitting quiz title
    - "hearts": {hearts}
    - "start_pool": "medium"

    Return **only** the JSON object, no other text:

    {{
    "boss_intro": "String",
    "quiz_title": "String",
    "easy_questions": [{{...}}, ...],   // exactly 9 questions
    "medium_questions": [{{...}}, ...], // exactly 10 questions
    "hard_questions": [{{...}}, ...],   // exactly 9 questions
    "hearts": {hearts},
    "start_pool": "medium"
    }}
